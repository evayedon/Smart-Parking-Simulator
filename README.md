# 🚗 Smart Parking System Simulator

## 1. General Description of the Problem

The **Smart Parking System Simulator** aims to tackle inefficient parking space utilization in urban environments by simulating a real-time system that tracks and manages parking availability.

This project demonstrates how **data structures** and **algorithms** can:

- Optimize parking resource allocation  
- Minimize driver search time  
- Maximize space utilization  

Core techniques include:

- 🔍 **Hash maps** for instant parking spot lookup  
- 📊 **Priority queues** for optimal spot assignment  
- 🧭 Real-time **visualization** of parking layouts and occupancy status

## 2. Itemized List of Use Cases

### 👤 **Driver-Oriented Use Cases**

- 🚘 Find the **nearest available** parking spot  
- ⭐ Receive **spot assignments** based on user preferences  
- 📅 **Reserve** parking spots for specific time windows  
- 🗺️ Get **navigation assistance** to the assigned spot

## 5. Unique Aspects of the Project

🌟 **What Makes It Stand Out:**

- 🔬 **Educational value**: Compare multiple allocation algorithms in real time  
- 👥 **Driver behavior modeling** integrated with facility operations  
- 🧠 **Multi-objective optimization** balancing:
  - Facility utilization  
  - Walking distance  
  - Traffic flow  
  - Revenue  

- 🧩 **Scenario builder**: Run "what-if" simulations before real-world application  
- 📊 **User-friendly visualization** for accessibility by both technical and non-technical users
